# Quoter

## What is it ?
A basic quote-management solution for the erudite or the occasional scholar.
This is, in no way, a replacement to existing bibliography tools like BibTex or the like.

Its purpose is to have a single place where you can store various quotation you want
to remember, and to offer basic ways of finding them, through author, sources, tags
or simple word search.

A basic template system can produce automated reference for the quotes if needed.

It's more a single-user app, though it can accomodate several users on a single server.

## Dependencies

Quoter uses Python & Django.
(Why ? Because I wanted to do something using Django, because I didn't want
to have to deal with sql on this particular project and because Django can
handle this pretty well)
(Why Python ? Because this is supposed to be the prototype for an another
project and Python is the best language I know for prototyping).

It uses the Django Auth library.

For the front-end bits, it uses Bootstrap and the Typeahead + Bloodhound mix
of the guys from Twitter. I added my own javascript, which is rather hacky and
could do with some refactoring, but, well, hey, it does the job.

## Development ?
This is a rather beta version. Update and deletes are yet to be implemented (though
it should be done soon). Search by tags is not there, and some user-management menu
would be nice too. So, it's more or less 50% done.

## I don't like webapps !

Me neither. I'll soon work on FQuoter, a command-line, haskell version of this
tool. So if you're interested in the idea, but not the implementation, hang in there.
